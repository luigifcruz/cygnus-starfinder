Work in Progress - Python script to estimate the position of starts based on photos from digital cameras. The script currently calculates the HFOV and VFOV of an image based on the automatically generated EXIF file. They aren't 100% accurate but they should work. After that, the apparent distance between stars is calculated based on these field-of-view values. Then, this distance is compared with the Hipparcos star catalog. This last part isn't currently working, maybe some fancy statistics can help here.
